# Hospital-Patient-System

To help with the battle against COVID-19, the Conglomerate Hospice Ltd. has asked for your help in
developing a system that will not only help to keep track of their patients, but also use some artificial
intelligence to place patients in to free rooms depending on their status.

Your system is to load existing patients and rooms from two flat files and then allow for the
management of the contents whilst the system is running. At any point that the system is closed, there
should automatically be new flat files that reflect the changes made whilst the system was running.
